# Advent of Code 2020

I'd like to get to better terms with Rust, so I'm hoping Advent of Code is the perfect time to do that!
Rust on the server seems such a nice fit (business logic running as efficiently and safely as possible, saving both time and money from a developer-effort and cloud computing point-of-view).

## Running

Install the cargo aoc runner:

```shell
cargo install cargo-aoc
```

```shell
cargo aoc
```

## Performance Target

All 25 days, combined, execute in under 100 milliseconds.

Exceptions:

- Day 15
- Day 17
